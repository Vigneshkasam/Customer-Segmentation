# Customer Segmentation

This project involves the use of K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending scores. The dataset, Mall_Customers.csv, contains various attributes of customers such as customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score. By applying K-Means clustering, we aim to identify distinct groups of customers with similar spending behaviors and income levels. This segmentation can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.
